# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam!

I'm a **junior software engineer** passionate about designing and building **distributed systems** and **reliable backend architectures** using **Java, Kotlin, and Spring Boot**.  
I enjoy working on systems that scale, automate, and integrate — from **microservices and CI/CD pipelines** to **modern application design**.

- 🚀 Currently exploring **full-stack development** with Spring Boot and React.  
- 🧠 Deeply interested in **distributed architectures**, **cloud technologies**, and **software security** (Spring Security, JWT).  
- 🎮 In my free time, I experiment with **C++ and OpenGL** to explore graphics programming and game engine concepts.  

💡 I love learning about **physics, mathematics, and space technologies**, and how software drives exploration and discovery.
